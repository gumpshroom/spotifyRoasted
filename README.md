This project is a Spotify Wrapper.

This project was done by Aaron Luu, Bao Nguyen, Nathan Nguyen, Eric Yang, and Patrick Del Rio for Georgia Tech's CS2340 course.

The Objective: The goal of this project is to design and develop a Spotify Wrapper for your Spotify account using Django and the Spotify wrapper API to show users a compilation
of their listening activity and trends. Features of this project will include a built-in AI model that generates a description of a user's music trends and how they would act/think/dress.
Another feature is making this web application user friendly, having dark mode as an option, being able to share a user's spotify wrapped response on social media, hosting it online for
people to use, and a page to contact the developers!
